# Superstore Transaction Analysis
### Feature Engineering (RFM)

This project uses data from Kaggle on Customer transactions to compute RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) and then segment through kmeans clustering.
The data can be found and downloaded here: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data

For this project, we download a subset of this dataset from a link made available through University of Washington (https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI420/2019/Datasets/SuperstoreTransaction.csv).
